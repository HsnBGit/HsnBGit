### 👨‍💻 About Me:

I'm a Software Engineering with a growing focus on Artificial Intelligence. I’ve built a solid foundation in front-end and back-end development, and have gained experience working with machine learning and computer vision. Recently, I’ve been exploring Large Language Models (LLMs), Natural Language Processing (NLP), and Generative AI.

I enjoy learning about new technologies and applying them to solve real-world problems. My current interest is in understanding how advanced AI systems like LLMs can drive innovation across different domains.

In the future, I’m excited to dive deeper into agentic AI and reinforcement learning. I’m always looking to grow, build, and collaborate on meaningful tech projects.
